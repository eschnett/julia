# LLVM has several code generation bugs for unchecked integer arithmetic (see
# e.g. #4905). We thus distinguish between operations that can be implemented
# via intrinsics, and operations for which we have to provide work-arounds.

# Note: As far as this code has been tested, most unchecked_* functions are
# working fine in LLVM. (Note that division is still handled via `base/int.jl`,
# which always checks for overflow, and which provides its own sets of
# work-arounds for LLVM codegen bugs.) However, the comments in `base/int.jl`
# and in issue #4905 are more pessimistic. For the time being, we thus retain
# the ability to handle codegen bugs in LLVM, until the code here has been
# tested on more systems and architectures.
